Hi,

1. I have created some dummy json. It only works for "Ordinateur" for now.
2. Just did the firebase configuration for Android only, will work with iOS once firebase logics are completed on Android.
3. It now works with firebase database, for q/a, result screens.
4. I attached the dummy json i created. App sets this json to firebase database initially, and integrates with firebase data now.

Let me know how it works.

Regards
